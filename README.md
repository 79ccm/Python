# Python
School projects in Python that use the arcade library (http://arcade.academy/)

Installation:

I didn't really plan on this being something you could just easily download and play, so you will have to install Python and get an IDE
and all that stuff. I will try to provide steps on how to do this:
1) Install python https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Install the Arcade Library, I used a library made by Dr. Craven that can be found here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arcade
3) Install an IDE, I used PyCharm but feel free to use whatever works for you. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

After doing all of that, you should be able to get the files for the game from this github, put it into the IDE and run it.
I will try putting a download link on the github so you don't have to deal with git commands.

The Great Skeleton War:

This is a tower defence game that has three seperate ages. The Stone Age, the Medieval Age, and the Modern Age. In each age you get new
towers that you can buy. There's a horde of skeletons coming to destroy your village and as the game progresses stronger skeletons spawn
in higher quantities. Oh, also you're a wizard that can cast spells. You can unlock new spells or upgrade your spells by killing enemies and leveling up.
